# Running other distributions

The boot path does not care which distribution it starts. The initramfs mounts the ext4 filesystem in the free eMMC
area, reads `/.mu300/boot-os`, and `switch_root`s into the directory named there. So a system is just a directory
with a root filesystem in it, and `mu300-os <name>` picks the one to boot next.

What a distribution has to bring:

* **arm64 (aarch64) userspace.**
* **It must work on Linux 5.4.** This is the limit in practice: the kernel is ZTE's vendor 5.4, and the newest
  userspaces have started to depend on newer kernels. Ubuntu 26.04 was dropped for exactly this reason — its `tar`
  resolves every path with `openat2` (Linux 5.6) and fails on this device.
* **Nothing else.** Drivers, firmware and the Android vendor chroot come from this repository's overlay, which is
  copied into every image.

## Ready to build here

| Distribution | Build | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu 24.04 LTS | `rootfs/` (default) | the tested default, systemd 255 |
| OpenWrt 25.12 | `openwrt/build-rootfs.sh` | router use, LuCI, ~140 MiB RAM |
| ImmortalWrt 25.12 | `MU300_FLAVOUR=immortalwrt openwrt/build-rootfs.sh` | OpenWrt fork with more drivers and LuCI apps |
| Arch Linux ARM | `arch/build-rootfs.sh` | rolling, 258 MiB image / 922 MiB installed; built, not yet booted on hardware |
| Debian 13 | `docker build --build-arg BASE=debian:13 -t mu300-debian:13 rootfs/` then `rootfs/assemble.sh` | same package names as Ubuntu |
| Kali Linux | `docker build --build-arg BASE=kalilinux/kali-rolling -t mu300-kali rootfs/` then `rootfs/assemble.sh` | see below |

## OpenWrt MU300 control panel

The OpenWrt rootfs built by `openwrt/build-rootfs.sh` includes the source-built `luci-app-mu300` control panel. Its
application source is from `dikeckaan/mu300-linux` v2026.10.11 (`5a892370`); the rest of this tree is based on
`oswaldxdd/mu300-linux` commit `3f5de63`. The image keeps its existing rootfs asset name and default LuCI theme.

The build installs the panel's menu, rpcd ACL, RPC backend, adapters, Chinese and Turkish catalogs, and the two
dedicated AT channels used by the dashboard and SMS pool. The dashboard can change persistent cellular locks and
run modem actions; an invalid network lock can disconnect mobile data until it is cleared. The AT page is root-only
through LuCI's administrator ACL and keeps the backend's command restrictions.

The SMS pool syncs SIM messages periodically through `AT+CMGL=4`; on MU300 this can change an unread SIM message to
read. The service copies messages to the local pool but does not delete them from the SIM automatically. Use the
panel's explicit SIM-delete action only when that is intended.

The U30 Air battery tile displays readings exposed by the running kernel, including instantaneous watts when the
fuel gauge provides the required values. It does not rewrite battery readings. The OpenWrt 2% versus Android 100%
disagreement remains unresolved and is not corrected by this panel integration.

The Languages page can still select LuCI's configured language. Its optional extra-language pack manager requires
`mu300-extra`, which is absent from this base tree; the page reports that feature as unavailable, and the build does
not claim to install the extra language pack.

The upstream panel release also changes WAN IPv6/NDP defaults. Those defaults are deliberately not included here:
the existing `network.wan` configuration remains in control. This build does not include the optional Aurora theme
APK; the panel uses the image's current LuCI theme.

The Arch build removes the `linux-aarch64` kernel and `linux-firmware` packages that the generic Arch ARM image
ships (about 1.5 GB): this device boots the vendor kernel from the boot image and takes its firmware from Android.
`pacman`'s Landlock sandbox is disabled for the build only, because it cannot work inside the build container.

## Kali Linux, honestly

Kali is Debian, so it installs and runs exactly like the Debian image, with its tools available through `apt`. What
it cannot do on this device:

* **No monitor mode or packet injection.** The Wi-Fi chip is a Unisoc SC2355 with a vendor driver that offers
  station and access-point mode only. `airmon-ng` has nothing to switch, so the classic Wi-Fi attacks are out.
* **No external Wi-Fi adapter**, at least not yet: the USB-C port runs as a *gadget* (the device pretends to be a
  network card for your computer). Host mode would be needed to attach an adapter, and that is untested here.
* **No screen.** Everything is over SSH; Kali's desktop tooling is pointless on this hardware.

What is left is still useful: a pocket-sized box with its own 5G modem that can run `nmap`, `sqlmap`, `metasploit`,
proxies and scanners over the mobile connection or the Wi-Fi it is connected to.

## Survey of the popular distributions (measured 2026-09-18)

Two things decide whether a distribution can run on this device's 5.4 kernel, and both are readable from its own
binaries: the minimum kernel its glibc was compiled for (the ELF ABI note), and whether its userspace already uses
syscalls 5.4 does not have — `openat2` (5.6) in `tar` is the one that bit us with Ubuntu 26.04.

| Distribution (arm64) | glibc needs | `tar` uses `openat2` | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 LTS | 3.7 | no | ✅ works (24.04 is the tested default) |
| Debian 12 / 13 / sid | 3.7 | no | ✅ works, built here |
| Kali rolling | 3.7 | no | ✅ works, built here (see the Kali section) |
| Arch Linux ARM | — | no | ✅ works, built here |
| OpenWrt / ImmortalWrt 25.12 | musl | no | ✅ works, built here |
| Alpine 3.22 | musl | no | ✅ userspace fine — but OpenRC, so the services need porting |
| Fedora 42 / 43 | 3.7 | no | ✅ userspace fine, not built yet |
| Rocky 9, AlmaLinux 10, Oracle Linux 9 | 3.7 | no | ✅ userspace fine, not built yet |
| Amazon Linux 2023 | 3.7 | n/a | ✅ userspace fine, not built yet |
| Gentoo stage3 arm64 | 3.7 | no | ✅ userspace fine; OpenRC unless the systemd stage3 is used |
| Void Linux | — | — | ✅ rootfs tarball exists; runit, so the services need porting |
| Raspberry Pi OS arm64 | Debian | no | ✅ Debian underneath; take the rootfs out of its image |
| openSUSE Tumbleweed | 4.3 | **yes** | ⚠️ works only after replacing `tar` (same trap as Ubuntu 26.04) |
| Ubuntu 26.04+ | 3.7 | **yes** | ⚠️ same; this is why the default moved back to 24.04 |
| Arch (official image), Void (official image), Clear Linux | — | — | ❌ no arm64 container image (Arch: use Arch Linux ARM) |

No glibc on this list demands a kernel newer than 5.4, so the kernel is rarely the blocker; what breaks is individual
programs reaching for new syscalls, and those can be swapped out one by one.

### The part that is actual work

The MU300 services — modem bring-up, the Android vendor chroot, Wi-Fi, the LAN bridge, the hotspot, the toolkit —
exist as **systemd units** (used by Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, Arch, Fedora and friends) and as **procd init scripts**
for OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt. A distribution with a different init (Alpine's OpenRC, Void's runit) boots fine, but
somebody has to write those ~15 service definitions again before the modem and Wi-Fi come up by themselves.

## What does not fit

* **Anything that needs its own kernel** (Fedora IoT, postmarketOS images, Home Assistant OS): they ship kernels
  built for other devices, and this one only boots the vendor 5.4 kernel from the boot image.
* **Distributions whose userspace requires a newer kernel**: Ubuntu 26.04 and later, and eventually any rolling
  distribution. Arch works today; a future `glibc` or `systemd` may end that, which is why it is the "fun" option
  and not the default.
* **x86 anything.**

## Installing a distribution you built

The installer knows `ubuntu` and `openwrt` by name. For anything else, unpack the tarball next to them and select
it (from Android, with the Linux filesystem mounted as in `tools/android-mount-mu300root.sh`):

```sh
mkdir -p /data/local/tmp/mu300root/arch
tar -xzpf mu300-arch-rootfs.tar.gz -C /data/local/tmp/mu300root/arch
echo arch > /data/local/tmp/mu300root/.mu300/boot-os
```

From a running Linux on the device, the same thing under `/mnt/mu300-disk/`, then `mu300-os arch` and reboot.
If it does not boot, the bootloader falls back to Android by itself, and `mu300-os ubuntu` brings the old system
back.
